/*
 * Brochacho catalog migration: keeping an existing config.json in step with new built-in commands.
 *
 * The bug this exists to fix: config.json is only written with DefaultCatalog.entries the very first time
 * Brochacho ever runs. Every catalog entry added in a later update (like "flip" or "settings") would
 * otherwise never appear for someone who already has a config.json, no matter how many times they update,
 * because loading a config that already HAS a "catalog" array just uses that array as-is.
 *
 * The fix runs once at every launch: add any built-in entry that is missing and has never been offered
 * before. An entry that WAS offered before and is missing now was deleted on purpose, and stays deleted.
