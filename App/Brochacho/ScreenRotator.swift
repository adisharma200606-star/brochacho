/// Turns the screen upside down and back ("one eighty").
///
/// The private-API calls live in `RotationBridge` (Objective-C; see `App/RotationBridge/.../RotationBridge.m`
/// for why it is not Swift). This file decides which screen, which direction, and — the important part —
/// checks that the screen *actually* turned before calling it done.
///
/// Why the checking matters: every way of asking macOS to rotate a screen can come back "fine" while
/// nothing happens. That is exactly what went wrong with an HDMI screen plugged in: one way of asking
/// works with only the built-in screen, and is quietly ignored once a second screen joins. So this asks
/// one way, watches what macOS itself reports (`CGDisplayRotation`, a public and honest reading), and only
/// if the screen has not moved does it try the next way. Asking again is harmless: each request names the
/// exact angle wanted ("be at 180"), not "turn by 180", so a late-arriving earlier request cannot undo it.
///
/// Every attempt is written to `~/.brochacho/flip.log` (overwritten each time), so if a future macOS
/// breaks this, one `cat` shows which ways were tried and what macOS said.
